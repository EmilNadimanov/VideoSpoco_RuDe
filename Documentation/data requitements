Due to the fact that the amout of data in ELAN files is limited, such data must meet some equirements to be parsed correctly by the scripts:
1) Tiers should be ordered correctly: a tier with utterances of a speaker in Russian must be followed by its translation in German. That is because such tiers are not strictly interconnected in any way, so we have to introduce other formal requirements to such data. Note that changing the order of tiers in ELAN(software) does not affect the underlying data structure, it only creates a .pfsx file (preferences). Therefore such data should either be reordered manually. So it would be either if it were created in such an order initially.
2) Paired tiers should be of equal lenth. Otherwise an error is raised. To track down such anomalies use the check_data.py tool.
3) Please name tiers with linguistic annotation the same way tiers with German text are named, apart from the suffixes. As an example, tiers with linguistic annotation and tiers with German traslation for a character named "Oma Schultz" should look like that: "Oma Schultz-Spch", "Oma Schultz-NVK" and so on. That is how linguistic annotations for tiers with text are extracted from ELAN files.
4) Please configure tiers properly. Tiers with utterances (lines, speech acts) should have type "utterance" and suffix "-Spch", both German and Russian. Annotations should have suffixes " AA" or " NVK". They can have other ones too, but you should change the regular expression in make_vrt.py then.
