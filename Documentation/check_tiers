This script can be used to check whether all paired tiers are of the same length and do not contain "None" fields. If they do, a proper message will be printed to stdout.
It only reads .eaf files and requires correct path to a directory with such files or directly to such files. Non-.eaf files will be ignored.

Script only runs through tiers listed in a set at the top of the file.

As an output it provides information about:
    1) Empty annotations in the ELAN file paired with its translation and the time when these lines appear in the video.
    2) Tiers which are either shorter or longer than their pair.
